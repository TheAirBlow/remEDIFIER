This isn't really supposed to be readable by a non-autistic human being. \
If you have issues deciphering this, make yourself a favor and click off xD

## Decrypting products_release.json
Use [this CyberChef recipe](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)AES_Decrypt(%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'HiO9d5jV0Ln7VNE5M%2BlM%3DE%26E%5EMobt_TA'%7D,%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'3-eM$%2BG6-UZBisv$'%7D,'CBC','Raw','Raw',%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D)) and input the file's contents.

## Format
Header (AA/BB), Length byte, Payload, CRC32. \
BLE above version 1 use encryption which I cba to document and implement. \
Probably for newer models, internally encryption is enabled when BLE version is above 1.
```java
public final byte[] addCRC(byte[] dataArray) {
    int i = 8217;
    for (byte b : dataArray) {
        i += b & UByte.MAX_VALUE;
    }
    int i2 = (i >> 8) & 255;
    int i3 = i & 255;
    return ArraysKt.plus(ArraysKt.plus(dataArray, (byte) i2), (byte) i3);
}
```

## D8 inbound aka. PAIN ðŸ˜­
Some of the last ones might be missing. Feature flags just get stacked on top of one another with time. \
`!!` means that feature's protocol was not documented. \
`??` means that the flag was not used in the frontend.
