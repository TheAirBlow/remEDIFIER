# remEDIFIER
A remedy for all of your Edifier needs!

## Disclaimer about USB
There isn't an endpoint to communicate directly through USB. But, the headphones **always** broadcast `EDIFIER BLE`, no matter wired or not. That means that this tool would still be able to communicate with the headphones, although you'd have to leave bluetooth enabled at all times. It's also a bit wonky, but works.
